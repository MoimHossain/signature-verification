# Signature Verification in python

We have two examples of signature verfification in python.
- [Using ecdsa](ecdsa)
- [Using cyrptodome](cryptodome)

## Usage

You will first need to install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the examples you can run `python main.py`.

[`ecdsa/main.py`](ecdsa/main.py) contains an example of how to verify the signature using ecdsa.

[`cryptodome/main.py`](cryptodome/main.py) contains an example of how to verify the signature using cryptodome (provided by pycryptodomex).
